## Scenario

**Digitizing Paper forms** Documents are uploaded using PowerApps which triggers a PowerAutomate flow. The flow scans the document using OCR and Text Anlaytics for Health extracts the relevant keyword.

## Overview

### Azure API for FHIR
The healthcare industry is rapidly transforming health data to the emerging standard of FHIRÂ® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). FHIR enables a robust, extensible data model with standardized semantics and data exchange that enables all systems using FHIR to work together. FHIR also enables the rapid exchange of data in applications. Backed by a managed PaaS [Azure API for FHIR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/overview) offering, FHIR also provides a scalable and secure environment for the management and storage of Protected Health Information (PHI) data in the native FHIR format.

### Power Platform Connectors for Azure API for FHIR
A connector is a proxy or a wrapper around an API that allows the underlying service to talk to Microsoft Power Platform. Connectors provide a way for users to leverage a set of pre-built actions and triggers to build applications and workflows.

The two Connectors that work with Azure API for FHIR contain a subset of FHIR Resources and are bi-directional, supporting both reads and writes to the FHIR Service.

**[FHIRBase](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/fhirbase/)** and **[FHIRClinical](
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/fhirclinical/)** are certified custom connectors that allows for building secure healthcare applications to enable interoperability using FHIR.

## Prerequisites

### Azure API for FHIR
- Deploy Azure API for FHIR with First Party Auth by [deploying via the Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir-paas-portal-quickstart). 
- To access the Azure API for FHIR, apply RBAC by adding users to `FHIR Data Reader` or `FHIR Data Contributor` role using Access Control (IAM). The users with access will authenticate through the Connector which assumes their role.
- Load sample data into Azure API for FHIR. 
    - Sample project to load data into FHIR can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/FHIRPower/tree/main/FHIR-Seed-Data)
    - Detailed instructions to load synthetic data can be found in the [OpenHack-FHIR Github](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenHack-FHIR/tree/main/Challenge01-AzureAPIforFHIR#task-2-generate--load-synthetic-data)
- See the following link for more details on [Using Azure API for FHIR](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenHack-FHIR)

### Power Platform
#### Certified Connector
- Get access to [Power Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/) environment to create Power Apps.
- Custom Connectors [FHIRBase](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/fhirbase/) and [FHIRClinical](
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/fhirclinical/) need to be added to your PowerPlatform Environment by an Environment Administrator.
- Details on [FHIRBase Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/fhirbase/#actions) and [FHIRClinical Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/fhirclinical/#actions) for API calls.
- Mapping [FHIR Base and Clinical Resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html) to FHIRBase and FHIRClinical connectors.
- More details on [Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/)

#### Custom Connector
- Instructions to create your custom connector, can be found [here][(./CUSTOM_CONNECTOR.md) ](https://github.com/microsoft/FHIRPower/blob/main/CUSTOM_CONNECTOR.md)
- Sample custom connector can be found [here][(./SampleFHIRCustomConnector)](https://github.com/microsoft/FHIRPower/tree/main/SampleFHIRCustomConnector)
