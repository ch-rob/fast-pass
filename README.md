## Overview

### Azure API for FHIR
The healthcare industry is rapidly transforming health data to the emerging standard of FHIRÂ® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). FHIR enables a robust, extensible data model with standardized semantics and data exchange that enables all systems using FHIR to work together. FHIR also enables the rapid exchange of data in applications. Backed by a managed PaaS [Azure API for FHIR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/overview) offering, FHIR also provides a scalable and secure environment for the management and storage of Protected Health Information (PHI) data in the native FHIR format.

### Power Platform Connectors for Azure API for FHIR
A connector is a proxy or a wrapper around an API that allows the underlying service to talk to Microsoft Power Platform. Connectors provide a way for users to leverage a set of pre-built actions and triggers to build applications and workflows.
